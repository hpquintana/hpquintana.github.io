> Who?

Hey there, my name is Hector and this is my blog. The blog mainly focuses on computer science related topics, as such posts will mainly be focused on tutorials, discussions, and more related to CS. That being said the target audience the blog is anyone that is interested in such topics. 

> Why?

I was inspired to start this blog after watching other programmers make content that was educational but uniquely modern. When they made a tutorial or covered a topic it wasn't 'dry'. The content was created in such a way that was easy for newcomers to understand while thoroughly covering the topic. This was achieved by going in-depth on topics that were popular at the time, such as blockchains and AI. The result was content that helped introduce computer science topics to people while not neglecting a meaningful conversation with those familiar with the covered concepts. 

> What? 

At the moment the blog will contain the following series of posts:

* [Behind The Code]({{ site.baseurl }}/categories/#behind-the-code) - Interview series with programmers. **Monthly** series.
* [First Impressions]({{ site.baseurl }}/categories/#first-impressions) - Short write-up on my first impressions on software/concepts/languages/etc. that I try out. May include quick demos. **Monthly** series.
* In-Depth Look - Detailed write-ups on programming languages/computer science concepts/etc. that I have experience with. May include tutorial and demo. **Monthly** series.
* [Weekly Update]({{ site.baseurl }}/categories/#weekly-update) - Personal posts where I outline what I goals I have for that week, mainly pertaining to personal projects. May include short discussions on issues that prevented my goals from being reached. **Weekly** series, on __Mondays__.
* Life-Hacks - Write up on tools that helped improve my workflow.
* Throwback Quicklook - I'll take a look at older software/hardware/concepts that are not in use through modern eyes. 
* Portfolio - A look back at projects what I was a part of!
