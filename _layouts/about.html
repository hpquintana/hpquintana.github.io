                                no matter the development situation. I achieve this by sticking to these programming
                                goals.

                                <p>Even when working alone I strive to make my work as readable as possible. This isn't
                                    always easy,
                                    I've had many code reviews where I have to explain my naming scheme, but it
                                    definitely makes it easier
                                    to work with other developers on a project. A side benifit is a much easier time
                                    fixing bugs that pop up
                                    months after you have finished your work.

                                <p>I want all my work to be as performant as possible, that way more people are able to
                                    use it. That's why
                                    I try to keep undeeded dependencies to a minium. This is sometimes difficult when
                                    it comes to developing in JS,
                                    after all it's so easy to find a package that does exactly what you want. But by
                                    cutting back on wasteful dependencies
                                    you improve not only performance but your skills as well.

                                <p>My specialization is not in security, I know that software is inherently vulnerable.
                                    But that does not mean I can't
                                    make wise decisions to decrease my software's vulnerabilities. Depending on the
                                    language and platform you're on this
                                    can be as simple as not using that package you found on Google to encrypting
                                    responses. Your software may not be dealing
                                    with sensitive data, but as developers I believe we should always act as if we were
                                    dealing with top secret data.
