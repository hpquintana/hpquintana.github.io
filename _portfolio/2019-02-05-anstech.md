Build upon the basics. This project at the moment is just a basic HTML homepage for online marketers [A&S Tech](https://anstechsolutions.com/). It was created using Bootstrap 4 and using A&S Tech's design as a guideline. In the coming weeks I'll be porting the site over to Jekyll in order to allow the team at A&S to easily create content for the site. 

The site is hosted on GitHub Pages and uses a custom domain. DNS is handled by CloudFlare, allowing for easy sub domain creation and improved speeds. 

Check out the site [here](https://anstechsolutions.com/).
