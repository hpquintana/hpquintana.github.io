                <p class="other-services-desc">WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT 3M SCOTCHGUARD®</p>
                <p class="other-services-paragraph small-font">Most carpet manufacturers apply some type of stain protectant at the mill. And that’s good. But it wears off with vacuuming and everyday foot traffic and the manufacturers recommend that it be reapplied periodically. 3M Scotchguard® rejuvenates the protective treatment that was applied at the mill. When applied, stains release more easily and spills blot up before they become stains. Vacuuming is even more effective because dirt and dust are more easily released, in the same way that water beads off a newly waxed car. </p>
                <p class="other-services-paragraph small-font"> We are so confident that 3m Scotchguard&#169; offers the maximum amount of protection that can be applied to your carpet. That means if you accidentally spill something that you can't take up with our free bottle of spot cleaner, we will return and remove it free of charge for up to one full year. The best time to reapply carpet &amp; fabric protection is right after it’s been freshly cleaned. Add this important product to your service today. </p>

                <p class="other-services-paragraph small-font">In a water damage situation, most people think that all they need to do is dry their carpet. This is how most mold problems begin. In any water damage situation, it is highly recommended to have an IICRC Certified Technician inspect your home or business and determine the extent of your damages using moisture sensing equipment. In addition to your carpet, they will inspect your sheetrock (drywall), baseboards, cabinets, wood floors, and any other building materials affected.</p>
                <p class="other-services-paragraph small-font"> Our water damage service usually begins by removing all standing water that may be present using our powerful truck-mount extraction units.
