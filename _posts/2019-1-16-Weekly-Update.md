Better late than never. This previous week was a hectic yet fulfilling one. So let's just jump into it.

## Previous Week
Last week I research cross-platform development tools React Native and Flutter in order to make my Pomodoro app. In the end, I decided to use Flutter for my project, mainly because I want to use Firebase for a future backend. According to my research, it is much easier to use third-party SDKs with Flutter. If it's not natively available you can always just port the SDK yourself, luckily for me, Firebase is available natively. My current progress is that I created a web app and created a native app for Android along with a Flutter app that both use this web app. I didn't make the progress I wanted but I did learn quite a bit about React, Flutter, and WebViews. You can keep up to date with my progress on this project at my [Pomodoro Timers GitHub repo](https://github.com/hpquintana/PomodoroTimers).

## Coming Week
This week I'll focus on taking the Tomato further, making a native Kotlin implementation and a native Dart version. Additionally, I'll be polishing up the web app version. And since I have a web app version I'll be looking into using that as a basis for a Chrome extension. My plan with this app is to eventually make one solution you can use on any device you're on so this will definitely help with that.

I'm also starting to write a post on a project from last year, Firebase URL shortener. That project was started near the end of October last year so I want to document the steps that I have completed so far and maybe get some feedback on improvements or new features I can add. I want to make that part of my 'Throwback Thursdays' set of posts so it might be delayed until next week but please look forward to it.

## Closing Thoughts
So ends the second week of my time taking this blog seriously. I'm quickly finding out the limits of what I can achieve with the limited time I have. Writing is getting easier as well, a surprising side effect but a welcome one nonetheless. I have many projects I want to achieve this year, so I'll keep organizing myself in order to make sure I achieve them all. Thanks for reading.
