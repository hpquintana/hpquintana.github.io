## Episode 0
How much do you know about your favorite programmer? Do you even have a favorite programmer? Right now we don't really focus on the people that make the software we use, with a couple of exceptions we just use the software and never give the creators a thought. So I want to take a step back and talk not about a programming language, IDE, or company but a programmer. They may not be as distinguished as Dennis Ritchie but they have a story to tell. So let's start with Behind the Code 0 - Hector Quintana. 

## Self-introduction
Hello World I'm Hector Quintana, the creator of this blog. I'm a software engineer of 3+ years specializing in cloud and mobile technologies. I'm currently employed at PartyFriends Inc where I'm in charge of the NoSQL database and the cloud functions that make up our microservices architecture. My preferred programming languages are Node.js, specifically TypeScript, and Java. 

## Why did you decide to study Computer Science?
This is a bit embarrassing to admit but I originally got into computer science because my friends were going to major in computer science. I went to an early college so I had to make a decision early on in high school, not having done much research I went along with what my friends were majoring in. Funny enough about a year later most of my friends changed majors to psychology, luckily I stuck with computer science.

## What project are you most proud of?
That's easy, a game I created back when I was in university. It's my favorite because it was the first time I challenged my programming skills outside of a CS class. The project also marked the first time I directly collaborated with others on a project. The project students that were CS majors, Math Majors, and Art Majors. Sadly the project was never completed but the impact it had on me is still felt to this day. Thanks to being part of this project I gained the confidence to start projects alone, with others, and take charge of a project. 

## Any current projects you want to share?
This might be a bit of a cop-out but this website is what I would like to share. Not because of the programming aspect, which _has_ been fun, but because of my plans for it. I want to make it a platform that really focuses not only on computer science concepts and knowledge but on the **people** that make computer science great. Programmers aren't really known for being social, yet a good programmer needs to work effectively with others. We **are** social, just in our unique way.

## What new technology are you looking forward to?
AI, more specifically OpenAI. I'm a big fan of AI and DOTA 2, so when I saw the OpenAI bot beat a pro player back in 2017 I was intrigued. Then when I saw OpenAI Five in 2018 I was really impressed. In just one year the bot went from playing a very basic game to playing a much more complex game and coordinating with 4 other bots. Not only that but it was able to put up a challenge against a professional team. As a DOTA 2 player, I find that amazing, as a programmer I'm excited by the technology. 

## Tabs or Spaces?
Tabs, much easier to use and more of a once and done thing than spaces. 

## Closing Thoughts
Thanks for reading what is the first in my "Behind the Code" series. I'll be interviewing programmers from now on so leave a comment below if you have any questions you would like to be asked or have any thoughts.
