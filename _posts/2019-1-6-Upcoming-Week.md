This will the first in a series of weekly posts where I share what I'm working on, studying, and/or attending. I'll also be sharing status updates on my projects and upcoming blog content. So let's just jump into it.

## Previous Week
So I've got the blog to a state that I am comfortable with. This past week I finished touching up UI, added comments, added time to read, and other small updates. My graphic design skills aren't the best so I commissioned a logo from a friend, we're still working out the details but expect it soon.  Apart from a missing logo, I am moderately satisfied with the current styling of the blog. Therefore visual design and UX will be taking a back seat while I focus on creating content for the blog.

## Upcoming Projects
First on the agenda is an app. I've been using the Pomodoro technique to improve my workflow and I have had great success with it. The only issue I have run into is that I hear notifications coming in on my mobile phone. It's distracting and tempting. I __could__ just go into silent mode but I would like an app that is suited for my needs, such as an app that lets me know which notifications came in during my work time and how many cycles I've completed. Therefore I'll be looking into making this app this week, I'm not sure if all the features I want are possible on both Android and iOS but I'll do my research. 

As I start on the app I have another goal in mind, learning a new method of making apps. My experience with mobile development is regrettably limited to Android apps, so one of my goals will be to make both an iOS and Android app. In order to achieve this, I will be looking into cross-platform tools that facilitate that goal. Currently, I'm thinking of giving either [Xamarin](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/xamarin/) or [Flutter](https://flutter.io/), yay for version 1.0, a try. My preliminary research is pointing me to Flutter, as I want to use the Firebase stack, but I'll do thorough research before reaching a final conclusion.

Additionally, I'll continue to update the blog with content. CES is next week and I'm excited to see new IoT and AI tech. So I'm currently planning a post on what caught my eye. Expect it sometime on Saturday or Sunday after CES ends.

Finally, I'll be meeting with some local programmers to interview them for upcoming [Behind The Code]({{ site.baseurl }}/categories/#behind-the-code) segments and potentially collaborate on a couple of projects. To this end, I'll be reading up on interview techniques and guidelines in order to come up with natural and informative questions. I would also like to make a set of "coding guidelines" that I expect from myself and the people I work with. I've done a similar list when starting Agile Development and Scrum to great success. So I would like to have something for personal use to improve the quality of personal work. 

## Closing Thoughts
Having written down all my goals for the upcoming week I feel excited, overwhelmed, and daunted. I'm confident when it comes to coding so I'm looking forward to the start of the app. But everything else is a bit out of my comfort zone. At the moment I'm not too confident in my writing, much less in my interviewing skills. Consequently, I'm anxiously anticipating going out and interviewing developers and writing further content. I'm confident going out of my comfort zone will lead to personal growth, so I'm ready to get out there and learn new skills. Thanks for reading, if you have any thoughts please leave a comment. Other than that hope to see you again next week in the next installment of weekly updates.
