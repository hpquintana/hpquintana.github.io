> "Hello World!" 

If you have any experience programming then you're probably familiar with that phrase. To many programmers it indicates the start of a new journey, your first experience with a new programming language. It's only fitting that I use it when I'm learning a new platform and embarking on a new journey, starting my own blog.

## What to expect

At the moment I'm not completely sure what I'll be writing here but I do have some plans.

### Daily Logs

When learning a new programming language, topic, SDK, or API I typically create a small project. Therefore one of the things I'll be using the blog for will be to share my experiences when learning a new topic. These experiences may be an issue I had when following a tutorial or an explanation of what I worked on. The goal of these posts will be to help me chronicle my knowledge while motivating me to go out and keep expanding my programming skills.

### Deep Dives & Tutorials

When learning a new programming language you often have a large choice of tutorials to guide you through the process. But I often find that these just teach _how_ to use the language and not _why_. During my time in university, discussions made material really stick with me, it made it material clear and easy to remember. Therefore I want to write some posts that teach you not only how to use a language but why you would use it and even when you would certain features of it over others.

### History & Facts

Learning about the history of a language and the people that created it may not help your ability to use it but I find it interesting. At the moment not many tutorials mention history besides the date of availability. I want to change that and share the story of programming languages and more. After all, if you learn why a language was created and how it has evolved over the years then you will definitely be better equipped to make an informed choice if given different options.

### Highlight Programmers

This touches upon my last point but I feel programming is very impersonal. Technology moves so quickly that we don't really pay attention to the people who make it popular unless they are extremely eccentric, looking at you John McAfee. So I want to highlight programmers in posts, get to know what path they took to get where they are today. They won't have to be famous, I just want to share their story and chronicle it in our history.

## Closing Thoughts

Well, that's what I have in plan for the blog right now. I'm sure we've all begun a project with a perfect plan only to see it turn out completely different so I'm not sure if I'll achieve my goals. But I'll sum up what I want to do with this blog with one sentence.
