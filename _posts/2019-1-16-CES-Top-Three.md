CES 2019 has already come and gone. This year we saw some amazing stuff, and some out of place things.  Who knows how many items will be actually be finished and released. But let's just jump into it, here are my top three items from CES 2019.

## [LG OLED TV R](https://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-OLED65R9PUA-signature-oled-4k-tv)

>What is it?

A TV in a new form factor

>What I like

OLED technology and form factor. OLED has been the choice of premium phones for a while now, it's a great display technology that touts better image quality and increased refresh rates. I'm a big fan so I was on board when I heard it was OLED on a TV. Then I saw the form factor and was blown away. The design might be impractical, fragile, and experimental but I love that it brings something new to the table. 

>What I'm not a fan of

The form factor. I know I said I love the form factor, and I really do, but it includes moving parts which inherently bring potential issues. How durable will the screen be if it's made to be rolled up all the time? What will happen if my cat jumps at it or someone bumps into it? Lastly, I'm not sure I like the concept of TV as furniture. It kind of harbors back to the past when TVs were more furniture than display.

## [Food Marble](https://foodmarble.com/)

>What is it?

A portable breath test device that along with an app functions as a personal digestive tracker.

>What I like

It can foods that might potentially be problematic for your digestive system. It does this by analyzing your breath for hydrogen which is released when bacteria in your gut break undigested food down. Apparently, similar technology has been in use in hospitals for some time now and it's the first device to bring this to the consumer. The benefits are less digestive problems if used correctly. Something that I'm sure all of us are on board for.

>What I'm not a fan of

Since I have no experience with this technology I'm left wondering how accurate a product like this can be and how valid the concept is. Before giving the product a go I would definitely talk with my doctor to make sure how much validity there is in the concept and how much of an impact it could really make. 

## [Acer Thronos](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/8/30/17799330/acer-predator-thronos-gaming-chair-hands-on-ifa-2018)

>What is it?

An all in one gaming chair. It includes a chair, triple monitors, desktop, and peripherals. 

>What I like

It's a ridiculous and awesome gaming set up. This is the kind of stuff I dreamed about when I was a kid in high school gaming on my Dell laptop.  That's not the only reason I'm on board though. The idea of a similar setup being used in a professional environment is appealing to me. I find multi-monitor setups great for productivity and having a chair that you can tilt for comfort would ensure maximum comfort. I don't expect to see it in use in any workplace soon, but I am hopeful that we might see similar innovations become widespread soon.

>What I'm not a fan of

From the demo videos I saw of the machine, it is still a bit awkward to use. Almost all of the movement is motorized, meaning to get in and out you have to wait for the machine to move. It might be petty but this part just makes me feel awkward. Whenever I'm on a PC I expect to get in and out easily of my chair, not have this slow process of just sitting down. 

## Closing Thoughts
I know this post comes about a week after CES has ended. I had planned to keep up to date with it on the daily and have a list by the weekend. Well, life got in the way and I wasn't able to do that. Additionally, a large amount of the items there this year were either too outlandish or too mundane. This might just be me taking technology for granted but I feel most companies are playing it too safe and making incremental upgrades or new products they never actually intended to release. Either way, thanks for reading.
