As I'm typing this it's almost Friday so it's not really midweek but I'll call it that anyway. Either way, let's just jump into it. 

## Throwback Thursday
Originally I was planning to make today the day I started a new series of posts where I go through my old projects and share them. Partly because I would like a portfolio but also to potentially start a discussion and improve my old projects. The first post was going to be a real throwback, a Java game I created back in university. Well stuff happened, hard drives were potentially lost or thrown away, so now I'm trying to find the old code through the people I worked with. Hopefully, someone backed it up to the cloud and I can bring you the post next week. 

## Flutter Like a Butterfly, Sting Like a Bee?
As stated in my previous post I want to make a Pomodoro Technique app for personal use. So these past few days I've been evaluating different cross-platform development tools to see which, if any, meet my requirements. What I require for my app are mainly two things, support for the Firebase SDKs and the ability to create and receive push notifications. I found that Flutter handles both of my requirements so I'll be moving forward with it. Although as I was doing my research I did come upon this interesting [video by Techlead](https://youtu.be/-n5G48o2bxQ). Basically, he brings up a good point, some apps can really just be webviews. Apps can be webviews and still be good apps, just look at Apple's AppStore. So alongside the Flutter app, I will also be creating a web app.

## Can't See Me
The rest of my free time this week was spent on bug fixes for the site and small UI updates. You may have noticed I created a [landing page](https://hpquintana.github.io/) to separate my resume portion of the site from my blog. And well...basically now I want to completely overhaul the website. Originally I used a Jekyll theme as I was unfamiliar with the inner machinations of Jekyll, it was an enigma. Now after having researched it, used it, deployed it, and updated it I'm comfortable with it. So I'd like to give a try making my own theme and making it available on my GitHub. At the moment I'm a bit busy with work and the Pomodoro App so I'm thinking I'll start with the site rework next week and maybe have it live by February.

## Closing Thoughts 
This has been the first real week where I give priority to writing articles for the blog. Writing was supposed to help me gather my thoughts and motivate me to see projects through to the end. So far I have to say it has helped motivate me, although I'm finding I enjoy writing these posts. I started writing posts back in December, back then a post actually gave me trouble to write. Sometimes taking around three or more hours spread over multiple days to write. Now with these last posts, I'm down to about an hour, often times I even have most of it planned out in my head ahead of time. Therefore thank you for taking the time to read this post and look forward to future posts.
