> A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step

I started this blog in part to chronicle my personal growth as a developer, my progress and setbacks. So I'll be integrating it into my daily routines. The plan at the moment is to write a short blog each morning on what I'll be studying up on each day. Usually I won't delve too deeply into these topics, they'll act maily as a journal and motivator to keep going. So let's start it off by sharing what's on my schedule for today.

## December 19 

The plan for today is simple, work on fixing up the blog. I started off the blog with a template and it gets the job done, but it's not what I want. My resume site has a theme going and the plan is to integrate that site with the blog. So I'll be updating the colors used throughout, matching the font, and updating the images used. After those tasks are done I'll rework the home page to be more blog like, do some design to reduce whitespace, and start brainstorming ideas for new in dept blog topics.
